# Development of an End-to-End Web Application Leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and OpenAI's API with Enterprise Data

**Course**: Generative AI  
**University**: Dauphine-PSL University

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a robust web application that integrates the principles of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and OpenAI's API. The application will utilize enterprise data to demonstrate the potential of Generative AI in enhancing productivity and task automatization, especially in customer interaction and customer service.

## Datasets

Simulated enterprise data will be provided, which includes:
- Twitterâ€™s customer support data: tweets from customers and replies from customer service
- ~~Customerâ€™s emails and customer service agentâ€™s responses~~
- ~~Customer service call transcripts~~
- ~~Company Knowledge base PDF document~~
- ~~Companyâ€™s FAQ~~

## Objectives

1. **Product Brainstorming:** 
   - Analysis and understanding of the available data. 
   - Identifying opportunities where Generative AI can provide value.
   - Exploration of potential applications using RAG and Generative AI on those data.
   - Choose an idea of web application to implement.

2. **Data Retrieval and Formatting:**
   - Extracting, cleaning, and organizing the provided data.
   - Formatting the data to be compatible with a RAG system.
   - Start with the sample data `twitter_data_clean_sample`.

3. **Development:**
   - Architectural design of the web application.
   - Building functional back-end components of the application using Flask in Python, integrating Azure OpenAI's API and a RAG system.
   - Building a user-friendly front-end using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
   - Storing data in a vector database, such as ChromaDB.
   - Version control with Git.

4. **Deployment:**
   - Deploying the application on an appropriate web platform.

## Expected Deliverable

- A fully operational web application that demonstrates the practical application of Retrieval Augmented Generation and generative AI using enterprise data.
- The project is available on GitHub.

## Project Timeline

The projectâ€™s GitHub needs to be sent before 15/03/2024.

## Advice

Begin by forking the repository into your GitHub and clone it locally.

Start with comprehending the data and establishing a clear objective for your application. 

Initially, construct a basic prototype of the front-end interface, utilizing ChatGPT for this purpose. 
Once the primary features of the front-end are operational, proceed to develop a straightforward Flask back-end. This could start as simply as returning the input message. Ensure the Flask server is operational and effectively communicating with the front-end.

Next, enhance the Flask back-end by integrating the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. Start by utilizing the provided sample file `twitter_data_clean_sample.csv` to enable the system to identify and respond with the most relevant tweet, using GPT-generated answers. Initially, employ an Excel file for storing embeddings, progressing later to a more sophisticated vector database solution, such as ChromaDB.

Further refine the application by improving the prompts, retrieval methods, and front-end features, such as adding translation and text reformulation capabilities. Then use the full data `twitter_data_clean.csv` in the app.

Finally, focus on deploying your web application. For hosting the Flask application, consider using a free platform like PythonAnywhere, which allows for hosting, running, and coding Python in a cloud environment.
